# Docsumo vs. Mistral OCR vs. Landing AI: A Head-to-Head Evaluation of OCR Capabilities

In the past month, the AI community witnessed the launch of two much-anticipated OCR solutions‚Äî**Mistral OCR** by the Mistral team (known for their LLMs) and **Agentic Document Extraction** by **Landing AI**, Andrew Ng‚Äôs company. At Docsumo, they live and breathe Document AI. So when these releases hit the market, Docsumo couldn‚Äôt resist putting them to the test

At first glance, these tools appear to be direct competitors in the Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) space. But upon deeper analysis, it's clear they only address a narrow slice of what a full-fledged [Document AI platform](https://www.docsumo.com/solutions/document-ai-software?utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=benchmark) like Docsumo offers.

Both Mistral OCR and Landing AI focus primarily on layout-preserving OCR. While they position themselves as groundbreaking solutions in document understanding, their functionality is essentially limited to extracting text while attempting to retain document structure.

## **The Key Difference: Docsumo Is Built for End-to-End Document AI**

Docsumo's platform is more than just OCR. It is an **[end-to-end IDP system](https://www.docsumo.com/solutions/intelligent-document-processing-platform?utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=benchmark)** built to handle document ingestion, layout-aware text extraction, intelligent classification, and schema-driven information extraction.

Here‚Äôs how Docsumo's native OCR stands apart:

*   **Proprietary OCR engine** with spatial awareness and layout preservation.
*   **Advanced preprocessing** including noise removal, image enhancement, and deskewing
*   **Structured information extraction** using schemas with key-value pairs, line items, and Q&A logic
*   **Two-way human-in-the-loop review system** for validation and corrections
*   **Auto-classification**, document analytics, metadata extraction
*   **Seamless export options** in JSON, CSV, Excel formats
*   **Integrations** with tools like Salesforce, Google Drive, QuickBooks, SAP, and more in formats such as JSON, CSV, and Excel. *(See all integrations here: [Docsumo Integrations](https://www.docsumo.com/integrations))*

# **Evaluation Criteria**

To fairly assess the capabilities of these three systems, Docsumo tested them on:

1.  **Text extraction quality**: Layout preservation, accuracy, completeness
2.  **Information extraction**: Accuracy of structured data extraction from OCR outputs using GPT-4o
3.  **Performance metrics**: Speed (latency) and cost per document

All evaluation results are **publicly available** at:
üëâ [https://huggingface.co/spaces/docsumo/ocr-results](https://huggingface.co/spaces/docsumo/ocr-results)

## **1. Text Extraction Quality**

Docsumo evaluated 120 document samples across invoices, forms, bank statements, and passports. Three human reviewers independently rated the outputs from all three systems.

### **üìä Unanimous Results:**

| OCR System                    | Preference Count (out of 120) |
| :---------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| Docsumo Native OCR            | 116                           |
| Landing AI Agentic Extraction | 4                             |
| Mistral OCR                   | 0                             |

### **üîç Limitations of Mistral OCR**

Mistral OCR struggled significantly across a wide range of document types:

**1. Pages misidentified as images**

*   Entire sections were returned as image placeholders like `![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)`
*   For example, in the below bank statement, a full table was treated as an image, with no data extracted at all.

**2. Frequent hallucinations**: In unclear or low-resolution scans, it often generated random, unrelated text.

*   **Poor table recognition**: Tables were treated as images or misparsed, failing to extract even basic cell content.
*   **Small fonts ignored**: Text stamps and fine-print content were regularly missed or replaced with gibberish.
*   **Inconsistent results**: Even with moderately clean documents, it often missed key data blocks or misinterpreted layout structures.

In short: while fast and cheap, Mistral OCR lacks the robustness required for production-grade document workflows.

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Issues with Landing AI's Agentic Document Extraction**

Although better than Mistral, Landing AI also revealed multiple critical flaws:

**1. Text summarization instead of extraction**

*   Instead of pulling exact content, the model paraphrased or over-described elements.
*   Example: A logo containing just the text "ABC" was transformed into a verbose 130-word description.

**2. Failure with vertical text**

*   The model consistently struggled with vertically aligned numbers.
*   In the below case, the text "89000458" was misread as "80000456."

**3. Inaccurate field labeling**

*   Labels were assigned even when contextually incorrect.
*   For example, a watermark number at the top of a table was mistakenly labeled as an invoice number‚Äîpotentially leading to major downstream errors.

**4. Misclassification of tables:**

*   Tables with fewer than two rows were not recognized as tables and were broken down into key-value pairs.
*   Invoices with minimal line items suffered most from this issue.

These limitations reinforce why generative OCR models like Mistral and Landing AI may not yet be suited for production environments where **precision**, **consistency**, and **fidelity to the original document** are critical.

By contrast, **Docsumo's native OCR preserves every word, layout, and structure‚Äîexactly as it appears in the source document‚Äîwhile enhancing it for downstream processing.**

## **2. Structured Information Extraction**

To objectively measure performance in an IDP context, Docsumo evaluated how each OCR system‚Äôs output performed when used for **automated key-value extraction** with GPT-4o.

### **Workflow:**

This method revealed the ripple effect of poor OCR output on downstream tasks. Once again, **Docsumo's native OCR yielded the highest extraction accuracy**, reinforcing its suitability for enterprise-grade workflows.

## **3. Speed Comparison**

| Model                 | Latency / Page             |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------- |
| Mistral OCR           | <2 seconds                 |
| Mistral OCR (Batch)   | -                          |
| Landing AI            | ~1 min (sometimes 2+ mins) |
| Docsumo Native OCR    | <10 seconds                |

While Mistral OCR is affordable and quick, its **low accuracy** renders it unsuitable for anything beyond trivial use cases. Landing AI is **significantly slower** and frequently experiences timeouts, further reducing reliability.

Docsumo, by contrast, provides a **balanced solution**‚Äîfast, scalable, and consistently accurate.

## **Final Thoughts**

The results are clear: **Docsumo's native OCR outperforms Mistral and Landing AI** across all key benchmarks‚Äîlayout preservation, information extraction accuracy, processing speed, and usability.
